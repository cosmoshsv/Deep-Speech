# Deep Speech Demo

### Training
[Colab Notebook](https://github.com/cosmoshsv/RNN-Tutorial/blob/master/DeepSpeech_RNN_Training.ipynb) contains training steps. The LibriVox corpus data is processed and stored using another notebook [Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/cosmoshsv/Deep-Speech/blob/master/DeepSpeech_Data_Processing.ipynb).


### Requirements
This requires Tensorflow 1.15.0 or version 1.x.


## TPU Training
Steps to run the code on TPUs are provided in the same notebook. Comment the cell in case of GPU training.
We did not notice significant speedup using TPUs over GPUs/.
